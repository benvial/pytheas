#  Python Electromagnetic Analysis and Simulation with the Finite Element Method

Pytheas is a python package for creating, running and postprocessing electrodynamic simulations. It is based on the open source onelab bundle for creating geometries, meshing (gmsh) and solving the underlying partial differential equations with the finite element method (getdp).
